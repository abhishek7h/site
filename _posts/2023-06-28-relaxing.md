We all have different ways of relaxing. For some, it’s doing something that they like to do the most. It can be listening to music, reading, gaming, or going outside for a walk.

For me, it’s music. I put on some music and close my eyes. I can relieve myself of all stress. By doing this, I wonder why I was stressed in the first place. It helps me to get everything together and freshen up my mind.

There comes the importance of relaxing.

It’s extremely important to relax once in a while. By relaxing, you’re taking stress off of your brain. You stress yourself way too much, so find your way of relaxing. It feels nice to be able to think straight again, otherwise, our brains would just be cluttered with thoughts, most of which might be negative.
