We’re often put in situations where we feel like just breaking. And we usually do end up getting angry or depressed, and we’d just ruin our mood.

The Art of Maintaining Composure is simple, just control your emotions. It’s easy to say, but requires some, say, practice. How do you practice? You go and stand near an irritating person. They’d keep irritating you, and you just need to try your best to not get angry or shout. I recommend to just smile at them. Much practice helps you do this easily. You wouldn’t even have to smile, you would just not get angry any more. That’s the power of The Art.

Another instance where The Art could be used is when people are laughing at you. My advice? Do. Not. Care. Let them laugh, they could use some laughing. Harness The Art. Stay calm and do not bother, you have better things to care about.

Learning to maintain your composure and work under pressure is a salient life skill. It’s easy to learn, but hard to master.
