This day marks the aftermath of British rule, the day we finally broke the shackles of oppression and emerged free, all thanks to selfless leaders who put the nation in front of themselves. We must be grateful for being able to call this land filled with culture, tradition and history our home. Independence Day is one of the most awaited and cherished celebrations of the plethora of festivals our country celebrates.

Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and a lot more fought valiantly to give Indians a better life, a life of peace and unity.

They wanted us to live in such a world where we would never have to fight anyone, a world where we all could enjoy and live long and prosperous lives.
To honour the wish of these great leaders who gave away their lives for us, let’s not fight. Let’s stand together because unity is our greatest strength. “Unity in diversity”, is what they wished, it’s what we all wish. It should be our biggest goal.

The main theme for this year is “Nation First, Always First,” as part of the larger “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav” Celebration. Let’s also promote the “Make in India” campaign to support Indian businesses.

Concluding, let’s all enjoy Independence Day to the fullest. Let's look back and honour the struggles of India's greatest people.
