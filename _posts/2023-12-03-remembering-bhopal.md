That unfortunate night in Bhopal, the Union Carbide factory leaked 40 tonnes of Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) gas, which led to a devastating loss of 16000 lives. More than 3000 people died in the first few days, and many more eventually died due to the harmful effects of MIC. This is the worst industrial disaster mankind has witnessed. My heart goes out to all the victims and may their souls rest in peace. I want to give immense respect to those who showed true valor to rescue people during trying times.

Recently, a series called "The Railway Men" was released on Netlifx. I watched the gripping four-episode masterpiece about the events that unfolded in Bhopal. The grasps for breath, the utter confusion, the immense pain, the cries of grief, the loss of hope, the sudden will, the ultimate sacrifices, the mighty courage, the strong determination, the unsung acts of The Railway Men. I was in tears when it ended. Innocent lives claimed and families destroyed, survivors left with the aftermath of MIC and PTSD. Truly heartbreaking, but we have to see for ourselves, the events that followed the leak on the 2nd and 3rd of December, 1984, in Bhopal.
