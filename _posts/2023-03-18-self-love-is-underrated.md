If you ever feel down, don’t start hating yourself. That’s the dumbest thing you could do. Don’t say, “I hate myself.” That’s like cutting ties with your only ally.

We often try to put the blame on ourselves by “hating” ourselves. This raises a question. What exactly do we hate about ourselves?

Our soul? Our physical body? Our mind? Our heart? Our attitude?

Here’s something you’ve gotta try; self-love.

> Self-love /ˌsɛlfˈlʌv/ Regard for one’s own well-being and happiness.

Deep down in your heart, you have a feeling like you know what’s the right thing to do, so just follow your heart. Do whatever you feel is the right thing to do. Do what you feel like doing and love doing the most; that’s self-care.

Had a bad day? Play some video games, or what I prefer to do is play football. For me, football is a magical thing that solves all my problems. I don’t really have anyone to play football with (except the wall), so I just play by myself, and I swear it feels so good.

So what you can understand is that doing what you love to do is loving yourself.

When you feel something is getting difficult, chill. Close your eyes and take a breath. Just chill out. If you cannot take care of yourself, how are you going to take care of the task at hand?

If you are hating yourself, you’re just getting into a fight with yourself. When you get into a fight with someone else and don’t talk to them, imagine how awkward it would be to be locked in a room with them. That’s exactly what’s happening when you’re hating yourself.

During the times when you’re alone, you are the only one you have, so be nice to yourself! Go for a walk, eat some ice cream, or do what you love to do because, at the end of the day, your happiness is all that should matter to you and that of your close ones.
