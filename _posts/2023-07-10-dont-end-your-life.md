Life is hard. Life is very hard. Life is a difficult race in which if you don't run quick enough, you'll be crushed by the stampede. You might have heard this somewhere, but that doesn't matter. What matters is your life. You don't know the value of your life. It's the most precious thing that you have, along with the lives of your loved ones. But whatever happens, quitting life should never be an option. Even if life brings you to your knees, don't quit. You mustn't.

800,000 people. That's how many people that die of suicide every year. It's heartbreaking, the concept of having to end your life, it hurts me. Even teenagers end their life, even before entering adulthood. A prime reason for that? School and society. Students are forced to study so much that it ruins their mental health, and society has this rule that if you are bad at studies, then you're good for nothing. Bad performance in the CBSE Board Exam? "Shame, shame!" says the society. It's about time they stop judging. The youth is killing itself, and people must understand. Be kind, you never know what someone is going through.
