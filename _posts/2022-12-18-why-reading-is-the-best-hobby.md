It is hard to find a hobby that suits you. Once you get into the rabbit-hole of finding hobbies, its pretty hard. You’ll find programming to learning an instrument, cooking to learning a new language, but also in this list you’ll find reading.

Books are like a portal. Once you curl up with a book you’ll jump to another dimension. Another world where everything goes according to the author’s imagination. It could be a perfect world, a disastrous one, or even another planet. And you can experience this all, through an imagination of your own.

Imagine a character, a leader leading his (or her) people. Watch the world through his eyes. Be in his shoes. Think his way. Get inspired and change the world. Be the new leader that the character has always been. “All Leaders Are Readers”.

Education can change the world. Education can change you. The more you read, the more you learn. By developing a reading habit, you are changing yourself. You are improving yourself. You are building your best self.

I used to be an avid reader when I was a child, I still am, but I don’t get that much time and all now. That was a grave mistake. Not making time for books. This resulted in me kind of losing my reading habit. But I was quick to get it back. I only read like 3 books this year. I should be ashamed. But I won’t give up my reading habit for anything in this world. Reading helped me become who I am. I read books since I was a child, it helped me improve my English, making me ace English in school. Reading books when I was a child was my best decision. Even if you are an adult now, keep on reading. Reading is the ultimate hobby, however lonely you are, books will always be there for you. Books are man’s best friends (Dogs are too).

Deleting mobile games was one of my best decisions. You see its kind of an addiction at this age, where my education is very important, I shouldn’t be playing games every free minute I get. I took the resolution to delete mobile games like last week, and it has helped me already. I read a lot now, I write a lot now. I have a passion in writing. I want to write a book, its one of the things in my bucket list right now. In fact, me and my best friend, who also is an avid reader, decided to write a book. I’m curious to find out how this one is going to turn out.

I stand by my statement that books are the ultimate hobby. There are other hobbies like programming, cooking, music, but books dominate this world. At least for me (and millions of other people too).

A reading habit is a person’s greatest power. Muscles somewhat help too, like opening a pickle jar. Jokes aside now. I recommend to find a favourite genre. Whether it be thrillers or sci-fi, find a book genre that suits you. My favourite genres are thrillers, humour and rom-coms.

For readers, a bookshop/library is like Heaven. I had this feeling yesterday when I went to the mall and entered the bookshop. I felt like I could live there. So. Many. Good. Books. I wanted to buy like 15 books but settled on buying 3.

Also try to find a favourite author, so you can just know who you want to take a selfie with first to post it on Instagram and Facebook and what not to make others jealous.

Concluding this article, I want to say that read read and read books. Develop a reading habit and find your genre.
