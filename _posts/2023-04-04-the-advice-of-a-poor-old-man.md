A few days ago, I was out shopping for guidebooks for my studies. I finished shopping and was out with my Grandma when a poor old man approached us and said:

“I’m blind in one eye and I’m really poor, I’d be happy if you could spare me some money for buying myself tea.”

We gave him some money, and he said:

“Son, I only have one thing to tell you. Study hard. These days, even while studying competition is very high, imagine the case if one didn’t even study?”

And off he went. He proceeded to ask another man for money to buy tea, but that man, however, said he’ll buy the old man tea, so the old man happily went with him.

This interaction hung in the back of my mind. What the old man said was very true. He seemed like a really nice guy and I hope his condition is improved.

We definitely should consider the advice of the old and experienced.
