Quitting is the easiest thing to do when you decide to start something new. We tend to just stay in our comfort zone by quitting, but it’s not a viable thing to do. We all have this flaw where we start something new, but fail to do it regularly.

> This article refers to not giving up on hobbies and passions. Please do not mix it with not giving up on alcohol, drugs or smoking.

When you feel like quitting, just remember one thing, why you started doing it. You might’ve started doing it as a hobby, you’re getting good at it, why quit? Not getting good at it, why quit? If taken in this sense, I should’ve quit Rubik’s Cube. So, I wanted to solve a 3x3 Rubik’s Cube. It was a seemingly impossible goal I had. I thought it was impossible to solve one. Then I started watching YouTube tutorials. One tutorial, however, taught me how to do so. I just had to master doing it, so I spent about 2–3 hours per day for I think about a week, and I had mastered it! The seemingly impossible goal that I had turned into reality! It was a great feat for me. I did it in about 5 minutes. My next goal was to reduce the time. For that, I had to practice a lot, which I did. But it paid off. I got a sub-120 solve, my best time being about 1 minute and 42 seconds. Still got work to do!

This little example of how I conquered something I believed was impossible and persevered by not quitting. If I can, you can too.

The motivation to not quit can be harvested from several sources, one example is haters. They’re just going to make fun of you and keep on hating you. You could’ve started something to prove them wrong, so don’t quit until you have proven them wrong. That’s the ultimate comeback you can have and shut them up.

Hence, you can conclude that haters are a good source of motivation. Seriously. Just think of them and you’ll get bursts of hatred which you can spend on the work-in-progress to prove them wrong. Use the anger and convert it to energy. Simple science.

As a human being, of course, you’d have tendencies to just quit, but you just need to remember that when you feel like you want to quit, know that it’s your sign to push harder. Personally, this is the one thing that keeps me going. When I’m on the verge to give up, I push harder. It’s hard at first to not give up, but eventually, when you start to get consistent, you’d wonder why you even thought of giving up.

The fact is even if you start the habit of not giving up, you are less likely to give up after starting something.

Here’s a thing: don’t give up on things you’re good at. If you give up on them, you’re underutilizing yourself. Similarly, don’t give up on things you like, too. Because at the end of the day, our happiness is the thing that matters.

Getting out of your comfort zone is a good thing to do. We all tend to continue with our same schedule, we hardly make time for anything new and hardly for our hobbies. So try to make time for this and don’t quit doing it!

One more thing to have is consistency. Be consistent. I became inconsistent in writing articles a while ago, but now I write regularly. That’s one thing you should note. If you’re not consistent, you’re likely to quit doing that.

After all of this, say you decide to quit. Ask yourself these questions:

- Why am I quitting this?
- Why I shouldn’t quit this.
- Why I should quit this.
- Am I happy after I quit this?

The only thing you shouldn’t quit is life. Whatever happens, just don’t end your life. That’s the only thing I ask you not to quit because ending your life is not worth it. Live, there are more things to come. If you are not feeling okay, get help and talk to someone.

### Summary

Quitting is easy. But facing all the challenges and riding the waves is the real fun of doing something. All you have to do is get out of your comfort zone and explore the world. If you start something, try to complete it. If you take up something new, do it regularly. Do what you want to do, what your passion is, and also do what you are good at. Haters are a source of motivation.
