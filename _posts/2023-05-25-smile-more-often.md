This is a reminder to smile more often. Smiling is said to improve your mood, and I can confirm. If I’m worrying about something, I just pause for a moment, and smile. It helps me to de-stress and figure out my problem. Smiling reminds me of some of my best memories, or it helps me to imagine some good moments in my future endeavours.

Smile while talking to people. This might show them that you’re interested in their company, it might also make their day.

Smile at people more often. Everyone. Smile at the cashier while checking out, smile at a security guard, smile at a store employee.

Smiling is scientifically proven to reduce blood pressure, reduce stress, reduce pain, increase endurance and more.

When a sad thought occurs to me, I just smile to forget that thought. Often it’s with memories, that just come at me, moments which I think if I’d handled differently would have changed the outcome. I just smile. I smile and think, “It has happened, no point thinking about it now. Forget it,” and I just leave it. This works for me. It helps me to overcome the thoughts.

Wrapping up, I just want to say smile more often. It’s good for your health, and others’ too.
