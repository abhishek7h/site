Programming is a really fun hobby once you get the hang of it. You could either design and make web apps or develop mobile applications. If you want to be a web dev, then learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you’re just starting out, I recommend you to learn Python. It’s an easy yet fun language.

Try playing some sports. You could just play with people or your friends, or get coaching. You could try Badminton, Football, Tennis, Basketball, Cricket, etc.

### 10. Running

Running is good for your health as it can help you build stamina. You can also get a good dose of nature if you’re not running on a track.

### 11. Walking

Not a fan of running? Just walk. It has nearly the same benefits, plus you can enjoy nature without getting tired quickly. I walk every day and it’s refreshing.

### 12. Cycling

Not a fan of both? Try cycling. Cycling is really fun, and it feels good when the wind hits your face as you’re cycling downhill whilst enjoying the scenery.

### 13. Yoga

Try doing some yoga, it’s extremely good for your health and mind. Try doing some from a YouTube video or go to a yoga class.

### 14. Gym

Get buff and build some muscles by hitting the gym. If you don’t have any good place to walk or run, use the treadmills. You can also lift weights.

### 15. Gardening

Gardening is a hobby that makes you feel better. To be close with plants and take care of them is a good feeling. You could grow veggies yourself or grow flowers to make a beautiful garden.

### 16. Photography

Some people consider photography to be hard and expensive. It’s really not, you only need your phone to get started. Start clicking away at anything that you find beautiful. You could also edit them on free software programs like Adobe Lightroom or Google’s Snapseed.

### 17. Cooking

Bring out your inner chef by making and trying new dishes. You could also try baking. Watch YouTube tutorials or follow blog posts. There are tonnes of them available.

Content creation is a good side hustle. It can range from writing blog posts to making videos for an audience. It’s easy to get started with, and it’s fun to do.

### 19. YouTube

YouTube is a good way to earn some money if you’re good at it. It won’t be quick, but with time you’ll grow. Just find your niche!

### 20. Podcasting

You can use Spotify for Podcasters (Previously called Anchor) to start a podcast in no time. You can either start a solo podcast or start one with a group of people.

### 21. Learn an Instrument

Bring out your inner musician and learn an instrument. You could try learning the Ukulele, Guitar, Piano, etc. Or you could just try vocals and do karaoke.

### 22. Learn a New Language

You could learn a new language if you’re planning to go somewhere for a holiday. The best app you could possibly use is Duolingo. It’s super helpful. I’m learning Japanese and French!

### 23. Chess

Chess is a game that requires a lot of strategy and planning whilst you battle the enemy king. It’s a really fun hobby to get into. You could play on Chess.com against bots, or play an online game against a human. It’s a fascinating game you should play at least once. It’d be hard at first, but over time, you’ll learn.
