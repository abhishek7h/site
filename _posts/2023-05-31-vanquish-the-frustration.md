There are multiple times when we get so frustrated that it feels like our head’s going to explode. The fact is, we can’t always let ourselves reach the point where we feel like our head’s going to explode.

What do you do? Vanquish the frustration. Defeat it thoroughly.

How do you do that?

Take a deep breath. Walk away. Talk to yourself in your mind. Take a deep breath again. Smile.

That should be enough for you to not make your head explode.

You have other things to care about that getting your head blasted.

There are extremely annoying people that make your life pretty hard. Just conquer your frustration. Frustrate your frustration, if that makes sense. If you’re getting frustrated, just laugh it off, you have other things to care about it. Why are you standing here getting frustrated? What’s the point? How is the stock market? If your stock crashes, learn from your mistakes.

That is, learn why you are getting frustrated. Find your weakness and fix it before other people get a chance to exploit it. You should always be on the lookout for yourself!
