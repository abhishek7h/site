People have different definitions for building a successful career. For some, a successful career is having the most enjoyment, for others it's the one that earns the most money. Regardless of how it's defined, building a successful career is something you have to do.

To do that, you have to follow the 3ds.

Drafting, Determination and Dedication.

First, you have to carefully draft and plan a blueprint for your career. You have to go through multiple fields and choose the one that suits you the best, and as Steve Jobs said, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." You have to make your passion your job and  you have to enjoy what you're going to do.

Second, you have to be determined. Once you've started, there's no turning back. While building a successful career, of course, mistakes are ought to happen, but they shouldn't weigh you down. Instead, you should learn from your mistakes, fix them and fly higher. The sky is the limit. People will make fun of you, they'll demotivate you, they'll say "You can't do this.", for that, your reply should be "Watch me."

Third, dedicate yourself to it. Promise yourself that you won't rest until you've built a career you're proud of. Work hard day and night, people are looking up to you, you have to work and work until you've achieved your dream career. You have to go through ups and downs in learning and mastering skills that will make you the best of the best.

You have to have the best possible mindset, you should believe in yourself that you can do it, and do your tasks effectively. Talk to yourself and think, if you are given a task at hand, focus on how you can do it efficiently and effectively.

Know your strengths and weaknesses. You have to be self-aware, know what you are good at and what you are not, and you have to tackle your weaknesses and do your best to improve them. We all may not have the same capabilities, but that doesn't mean we should let it be, instead we have to work hard to become more capable of something.

Inside and outside the workspace, you have to follow four simple principles:
Modesty, Responsibility, Honesty and Kindness.

You have to be modest and humble, you can't let your ego take over. You have to be humble of your abilities, never be boastful and you shouldn't be rude to your colleagues.

You must be responsible, you have to take your job seriously and do everything properly, one way to do it is you should be satisfied with your own work. Fulfill duties in time and never be late.

Honesty is the best policy. Just be frank and straightforward. Never do wicked work, you should always follow the right path. People may be choosing the wrong path, but you have to right the wrong and only walk through the path that follows kindness and good work.

Finally, kindness. Whoever you are, you should be kind to your colleagues or to anyone, inside and outside the workspace. However rude the other person is, you should never take violence as a solution. You have to be kind and understanding.

In my view, a successful career is built when you enjoy doing your job. Money may matter, but it's not the ultimate aim. The ultimate aim should be to help people. You have to always be positive and be kind. You just have to keep doing the great work that you've always done. You will eventually gain respect for the work you do. That's when you know what you've done all along paid off, the hard work you've done, the pain you endured to train. You thrived and flourished and built a successful career.
