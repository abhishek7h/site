As humans, our instinct is to just stay idle and not do anything when we have the choice, but most of the time we’re forced to work for a living. In our free time, we might just not do anything productive and just relax. I know it’s okay to relax and we should take breaks, but it doesn’t mean that we can keep relaxing. If one task is over, take breaks and start the next one.

Getting out of your comfort zone is hard, but once you get out and explore, it’ll be worth it. Try out something new, start working out, meditate, do something beneficial. If you work today and you can rest tomorrow.

If you do 15 push-ups and you’re at your limit, do 5 more. Push yourself to your absolute limits and beyond. Ran 10 rounds? Run 1 more. Did 30 reps? Do 20 more. Keep beating your own personal records.

Keep trusting the process and work hard.
